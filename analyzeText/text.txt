This summer was one of the best I’ve ever had. In June, I traveled to Italy with my family—my parents, my sister, and my cousin. We spent two amazing weeks exploring Rome, Florence, and Venice. In Rome, we visited the Colosseum, the Vatican, and countless historical sites. It was incredible to see places I had only read about before in history books.

After Italy, in early July, I went to a summer camp with my friends from school. The camp was located in the mountains near Lake Tahoe in California. We did all kinds of outdoor activities—hiking, kayaking, and even rock climbing. My best friend, Jake, was my partner during the camp’s famous treasure hunt, and we managed to find all the clues and win the prize!

By August, I was back in my hometown, and I spent most of the month volunteering at the local animal shelter. I helped feed the animals, cleaned their spaces, and even got to walk some of the dogs. It was rewarding and gave me a sense of purpose.

Overall, this summer was full of travel, adventure, and meaningful experiences with family and friends. I can’t wait to see what next summer has in store!
